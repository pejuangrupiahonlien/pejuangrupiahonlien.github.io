Traveling during the holidays is very exciting and there is plenty going on all around you. However, it is very important that you remain alert so you won't be involved in an accident or become a victim of theft. There are plenty of criminals that target holiday travelers as they know they are likely to have money on them and they aren't always paying attention to their surroundings.

Accidents can take place anywhere during holiday travel so you need to be prepared for the unexpected. Never speed when you are driving and make sure you have your seat belt on. Allow at least one car length between you and the person in front of you. Should they have to brake quickly you don't want to rear end them or end up being hit by the vehicle behind you. 

Pay close attention for animals crossing the road as they can be a hazard. Even though you don't want to hit them, slamming on your brakes or swerving can result in an accident. If you do have to swerve always go to the right so you will be off the road instead of into oncoming traffic. 

There will be people along the side of the road that have been involved in accidents or their vehicles have broken down. If you decide to stop and help them be very careful of the traffic that is coming along. If you decide to keep going you should switch lanes if possible or at least move over as far as possible. You don't want to accidentally hit someone that is walking around on the road.

While it is human nature to be compassionate and to attempt to help others you need to be careful. Scams often occur during holiday travel and you may encounter people asking for money or a ride. Trust your instincts and if you don't feel comfortable with the circumstances you need to leave.  You can always use your cell phone to call the local authorities to give them a hand. 

Never drive when you are too tired to focus your attention on the road. Too many people traveling for the holidays haven't gotten sufficient rest along the way. Don't kid yourself into thinking that a soda or several cups of coffee are going to keep you awake. Driving while you are tired increases your chances of making mistakes and also prolongs your reaction times.

Whether you are driving yourself or taking another method of transportation, you need to keep a close eye on your items. Don't fall victim to having your luggage, purse, or wallet stolen by someone because you left it unattended. Men should keep their wallet in their front pocket and women should keep their purses over their head across the shoulder and to the opposite arm.

If you are traveling with a spouse or other adult it is a good idea for each of you to carry some money and a credit card with you. This way if someone does get your materials you won't be completely without access to other forms of payment you may need. It is also a good idea for each of you to carry a copy of the itinerary with confirmation numbers. This way you are likely to have one copy if the other gets lost. It is also helpful if you get separated in a crowded airport. 

Traveling during the holidays can be fun and a great way to get away from your daily routine. Follow these tips to help keep yourself alert so you can have the very best time possible. Most accidents are the result of people being tired or being in too much of a hurry so get enough rest and take your time to arrive safely. Always pay close attention to your personal belongings and report any suspicious behaviors you may encounter.
