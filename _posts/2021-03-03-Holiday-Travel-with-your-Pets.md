The holidays are a time when many people travel, and that leads to the dilemma of what to do with the family pets. Many people choose to bring them along because they don't have anyone to care for them and they don't want to place them in a dog kennel for the duration of their holiday trip.

Traveling with your pets for the holidays can be a pleasant experience if you are prepared for it. Otherwise it can turn into a nightmare due to the care your pets need and where you will be staying. If you are visiting family or friends of the holidays you really need to make sure they are comfortable with you bringing you pets along. 

Keep in mind that most hotels won't allow you to keep pets in your room. Make sure you look into this information before you secure the reservation. Those hotels that do offer you the right to bring your pets will you will charge you a deposit just in case your pet destroys something in the room during your stay.

Most airlines will make accommodations for your pets to travel in the plane but they have to be secured in a carrier. This can be very stressful for pets that are used to roaming around freely. They will have to fly in the cargo area of the plane unless the airline allows small cats and small dogs to be placed under your seat for the duration of the flight. 

If you plan to place your pet in a carrier let them get used to it in the weeks prior to your travel plans for the holidays. This way they won't be so overwhelmed by the concept of being in the carrier for the duration of the flight. This can be quite traumatic for your pet and you don't want them injuring themselves during the flight. 

 Keep in mind that they will charge you more if your pet is aboard the plane with you instead of with the cargo. Still, this is a great way to ensure your pet is being well cared for while your travel for the holidays. If you have any connecting flights though you will definitely want to keep your pet on board with you. The risk of losing your pet this way will really put a damper on the holiday festivities. 

You will not be able to take your pets along with you on the bus lines or the train due to their strict guidelines. The only exception to this rule is seeing eye dogs as not allowing them on board is a violation under the Americans with Disabilities Act. As a result many people traveling with pets for the holidays decide to take their own vehicle.

Make sure you have plenty of food and water for them so they can stay hydrated and feeling well. If you are traveling by car you need to plan to stop often for them to exercise and use the bathroom. It is a good idea to take along their favorite toys or blankets in order to minimize their stress during travel. 

Pay close attention to the weather for your holiday travel as it can be quite a change for your pet. They are likely used to their normal climate and they may have trouble coping with the extreme heat or the extreme cold. 

It is very possible to travel with your pets for the holidays but it take plenty of planning. You want them to be as comfortable as possible without it affecting your ability to enjoy traveling for the holidays as well. Even though you may want to have your pets with you, carefully weigh the decision. If you determine that they travel conditions won't be right for them then find a quality kennel for them to stay at so you can still enjoy your holiday travel.
