    "title": "Tips For Stopping Spraying",
    "body": "2021/02/22 - Anytime your cat backs himself up to a door or other object in your house, lifts his tail, and releases urine , you have a problem.  This problem is known as spraying, and is very common with cats kept indoors.  Even though it is a very annoying problem, it’s a problem that can be solved. Contrary to what many think, spraying isn’t a litter box problem, but rather a problem with marking.  Cat urine that is sprayed contains pheromones, which is a substance that cats and other animals use for communicating.  Pheromones are much like fingerprints with humans, as they are used to identify the cat to other animals. When a cat sprays something, he is simply marking his territory through his urine.  The spraying is simply the cat’s way of letting others know that the territory is his.  Even though it may make you mad and annoy you, getting angry with your cat will solve nothing.  If you raise your voice or show angry towards your cat, it can very well result in more spraying. Cats that are in heat are easily attracted to the odor of urine.  For cats in heat, spraying is more or less an invitation for love.  Often times cats that spray while in heat results in a litter of kittens that are born in just a few short months.  Keep in mind that cats not only spray during heat, as some will also spray during encounters with other cats, or when they are feeling stressed. Although spraying is a way of communicating for cats, the smell for people is horrible.  The good thing here is that most cats will do a majority of their spraying outdoors.  If you have an indoor cat that never goes outside, spraying can indeed be a problem.  If you’ve noticed spraying in your home, you should take action and do something about it immediately. The most effective and also the easiest way to stop spraying is to have your cat either neutered or spayed, which of course depends on the sex.  Most male cats that have been neutered will stop spraying the same day they have the surgery. If you don’t want to get your cat neutered or spayed, you should look into other options.  If you hope to one day breed your cat, you certainly don’t want to have him neutered or spayed. The best thing to do in this situation is to talk to your veterinarian.  He will be able to give you advice, and possibly even solve the problem without having surgery.  There may be a medical problem present that is causing the problem, which your vet can identify.  You should always do something about spraying the moment it starts , simply because cat urine stinks and it can leave stains all over your home. "

    "title": "Tips For Introducing Cats",
    "body": "2021/02/22 - When you decide to add a new cat to your home, it’s normally more exiting for you and your family than it is for the cat you already own.  Although most cats are solitary by nature, most will also come to accept or eventually tolerate any additions.  Cats can be very territorial, which is why you should always be careful when you introduce a new cat to your current cat. If you are introducing kittens to one another, the entire introduction process can be short, lasting as little as 10 , 15 days.  Introducing cats to each other all depends on their temperament and their personality.  When you introduce a new cat to your current cat, you should always make sure that you give your current cat plenty of love and attention.  This way, your cat will feel secure and know that he isn’t in competition with your new cat for affection. When you bring your new cat home, you should let him stay in a safe room until you have finished introducing the cats.  Your safe room can be any small room in your home, such as a bathroom or spare bedroom.  The key here is to use a room that your current cat doesn’t go in.  In the room, you should leave your new cat a scratching post, bed, water dish, litter box, and food dish. At first, your current cat may howl and hiss when he stands at the door, trying to tell the other cat that he doesn’t belong.  When this happens you should ignore it, as punishing your cat for his behavior will only lead to more problems.  After a while, the first cat will start to act calm when he is near the new cat’s door.  As he starts to act calm, you should pet him and give him praise. When your first cat starts to go by your new cat’s door and doesn’t howl or hiss; you can start introducing them to each other.  The best way to do this is to get them used to each others scent.  You can start letting them eat out of the same food dish, although you’ll want to feed them at different intervals at first.  This way, the scent of each cat will be present at the food dish, and each cat will get the scent when he eats his food. Once both cats have got used to the scent, you can begin to feed them closer together.  To do this, you should keep your new cat in the safe room with the door closed, and your first cat on the other side of the door with his food dish.  This time, feed both cats at the same time.  After doing this a few times, they should start eating without any hissing or growling.  At this point, they are ready to be introduced to one another. When you introduce them to each other in the same room, a bit of growling and hissing is to be expected.  Although they may be used to each others scent; your first cat will still feel a bit awkward with your new cat being in his territory.  You should play with them both at first, so they can smell one another and greet in their own way. If they start to fight you should break them up, and give them some time apart. It may take some time to get them fully used to one another, although once they do , they will become playmates for life.  Cats love to be social, although it may be a bit rough at first, especially for your first cat.  Cats can be very territorial, especially if you have a kitten around.  If you get both of them used to each other early on , it will be a lot easier to add future cats to your home. "

    "title": "Things To Know Before Breeding Your Cat",
    "body": "2021/02/22 - The population of cats is the United States alone is unbelievable.  Nearly all experts will tell you that you should spay your cat instead of breed it.  No matter what experts have to say, a lot of people want to have a litter of kittens from their cat.  Before you decide to breed your cat, there are a few things that you should think about. The first thing you should know is that breeding cats takes time.  For the next two months after the litter is born, you’ll need to clean the area on a daily basis.  You’ll also need to watch over the kittens as well, and keep a close eye on how they are developing.  If you plan to breed a litter of cats, you won’t have time for much of anything else. Breeding cats will also require a good degree of space as well.  If you have a small apartment, you shouldn’t attempt to breed a cat.  You should also make sure that your family agrees with the idea, as it isn’t good for the kittens if you keep them locked up.  Keep in mind that kittens like to see things; they’ll end up going all over your home as well. Breeding cats also requires a degree of responsibility as well.  You should always have a plan of approach, including homes for the kittens to go that you aren’t planning to keep.  Keep in mind that things can change, someone who wanted a cat may change his mind once the litter is born.  In this event, you must decide whether or not you can keep a kitten that doesn’t have a home. Breeding also requires some education as well.  You should be prepared for any problems along the way, as well as what takes place during birth.  From cutting umbilical cords to delivering early, you’ll need to be well prepared.  You should also have the proper supplies, and know how to handle things in the event of a c-section.  You’ll also need to know what to feed pregnant cats, as their diets are very important if you are breeding. Breeding will also cost money as well, with kittens costing a lot more money than you may think.  The food isn’t the only thing that’s expensive, as the vet bills can also get expensive.  Even though you may go through the entire pregnancy without going to the vet, you’ll still need de-worming and vaccination medicines as well. In short, there is a lot to think about where breeding is concerned. If you have your mind set on it and you want to breed, you should be sure that you have the proper knowledge and everything you need before hand.  You should always be ready to handle anything associated with breeding , and prepare yourself for the worst possible scenario. "

    "title": "Things To Know About Abused Cats",
    "body": "2021/02/22 - Cats that have been abused can appear severely maimed and damaged all over their exterior.  Some may appear to be in perfect shape on the outside, although all of the damage they sustained may be internal or emotional.  Even though physical damage is bad, emotional damage is much tougher to fix.  Cats who have physical abuse will still answer to a soft touch and soft voice, as long as they know that the abuse has come to an end. When you have a cat that has been emotionally abused, you’ll need to wait until the cat comes to you.  You’ll need to use patience, as the cat will be confused and not know if you plan to hurt him or not.  If you take your time and let him know that you are nothing to fear, he will eventually come to you.  When he starts to come to you, you can let him sniff you and pet him.  After a while, he will learn that he can trust you and he will come to you when you call him. Yelling, raising your voice, or using disciplinary tools such as flyswatters or water guns the wrong way can lead to emotional damage.  If you continue to use the wrong means of discipline on an emotionally damaged cat, the cat can become mean or lethargic.  When a cat turns mean, it’s not always a bad thing.  Meaner cats are easier to reach, as they still care a bit about what happens to them and while lethargic cats could really care less. Cats that have become lethargic won’t play, take treats, or respond to anything you say to them.  With a lethargic cat, the ideal way to get him to respond is to bring in a companion cat.  Over time, a lethargic cat will eventually look for attention, normally a scratch or a pat.  When this happens, you should always use a soft voice and snuggle with him.  Never raise your voice at this point, and make sure you let the cat know that his behavior is a lot better. You should make slow movements around a lethargic cat, as he is still quite traumatic.  Once he is coming around and letting you touch him again, he is getting back to his normal self.  Keep in mind that it may take some time, which is to be expected with this type of situation.  If your cat starts to get upset again or if you raise your voice, he will hide again.  If you continue to use a soft voice and have patience, your cat will eventually get past this.  If you get a cat that is lethargic, you should prepare yourself for a long and very intensive healing period. Angry or mean cats on the other hand, will either fight and scratch with you, or simply run away from you.  With mean cats, the best thing to do is use gentle treatment with a soft voice.  You can never try to raise your voice or use strict discipline, as it will only make the cat meaner.  Never attempt to trap the cat either, as trapping it will only make the cat react.  If you take your time and let the cat know that you are there for him, he will eventually calm down. Abused cats are truly a sad thing, although they are out there.  Abused cats can be a sad thing to see indeed, especially those that were physically abused.  Abused cats need a loving home and a loving owner who will give them the type of lifestyle they deserve.  Always remember that if you are dealing with an abused cat and you should always be as gentle as you possibly can. "

    "title": "The Cruelty Of Claw Removal",
    "body": "2021/02/22 - Cats use their claws for various purposes.  The claws are important to cats, as they are an essential part of balancing.  If you’ve ever noticed a cat jumping and latching on to a high object, you’ve probably noticed that he uses his claws to pull himself up.  When climbing trees, cats tend to use their claws to latch onto the bark and climb towards their destination. Cats also use their claws for stretching, walking, and running as well.  The claws are also a cat’s primary source of defense against other animals and humans as well.  Most cats keep their claws extremely sharp, as their claws and teeth are basically their only weapons.  The claws are also essential for using the bathroom as well, as cats use them to cover up their mess with dirt. Cats also use their claws to scratch things, which mark their territory.  Their claws have glands, which contain a secretion.  When they leave their mark on something, the secretion is transferred to the area they scratched.  This is detectable to other cats although not to humans.  Sometimes, they will also scratch something to remove the older claw which will fall off and give them a brand new claw that resides underneath. As sad as it is, a lot of pet owners choose to put their own possessions above their cat, such as their expensive furniture or carpets.  These cat owners are afraid that they cat will ruin their furniture or carpet, and therefore will choose to get their cat de-clawed.  Getting a cat’s claws removed is a surgical procedure, one that can only be performed by a veterinarian.  The owner will need a good reason though, as a vet won’t do the surgery just to keep one’s furniture or carpet protected. If you’ve been thinking of getting your cat de-clawed, you should know that the process can totally change his personality.  Once the cat is de-clawed, he will be in pain and confused.  He may not be able to jump in the window or on the couch, and he may not be able to play like he once did.  Some cats, after being de-clawed, tend to get aggressive and bite with their teeth.  To make a long story short, the cat will be completely miserable and which is a tough thing to bear for those who love their cats. Those who decide to own cats should know that a cat can scratch on occasion.  If someone isn’t prepared to deal with that fact, they shouldn’t own a cat in the first place.  Cats are great pets, although they do have claws and they will use them on occasion.  There are plenty of other great pets out there, if you aren’t up for handling a cat.  If you’re just worried about your furniture or carpet, there are ways that you can keep your cat from scratching on your belongings. The first thing to do is to get your cat a scratching post and let him know where it is and how to use it.  You can also get a rush mat as well, which will help your cat with his instincts to scratch.  You may have to demonstrate how to use the mat or the post at first, although your cat should catch onto it quick.  Once you have shown him the ropes, he will scratch on the post or the mat , and not your furniture or your carpet. Although many don’t realize it, there are other ways to protect your things other than getting your cat de-clawed.  Getting a cat’s claws removed is very painful and confusing to the cat, and may totally change his outlook on things.  Before you decide to take the inhumane path of getting your cat de-clawed, you should look into your other available options- your cat will like these options much better. "

    "body": "2021/02/22 - A cat whisper is somewhat similar to a dog or horse whisperer, although cat whisperers relate quite well with cats.  These types of people are unusually lucky and very successfully with cats.  In most cases, a cat will be abandoned or just show up at someone’s door.  In this event, the cat will adopt this individual as the cat whisperer. Often times, alley cats and black cats will show up at someone’s door and decide to move into their homes.  This can be a result of abandonment, or the cat’s family moving away and simply leaving the cat behind.  Sometimes, the cat may decide that he likes someone else’s home better and decide to move there instead of staying with his owner. A lot of people will tell you that a cat whisperer can be thought of as a therapist for cats.  Almost all cat whisperers haven’t have any type of training, what they know just seems to come to them naturally.  These types of people understand the way a cat thinks and knows how to work with the cat to achieve the results they want.  Even though many think of a cat whisperer as a therapist, it actually couldn’t be further from the truth. Cats who have been abused or mistreated, often times won’t respond to anyone but a cat whisperer.  Although others may have tried to help the cat, it will only make matters worse by making the cat feel scared and afraid.  In most cases, these cats will end up in a pound.  This is very tragic, as the cats have already endured more than they ever should have.  A majority of the cats who have been abused were once loved pets.  Along the way, they were abandoned, mistreated, attacked by dogs, and in some cases tortured. Cats who have been treated unfairly often times won’t trust anyone. They are often times confused, in a lot of pain, and not sure what they should do.  Like humans, cats feel pain.  Those that have been physically abused are a sad sight indeed.  Emotionally damaged cats may appear to be in perfect health on the outside, although their emotions are a wreck.  Emotionally abused cats are much harder to get through to, especially if they were stray cats to begin with. Cat whisperers on the other hand, can communicate with physically and emotionally abused cats.  Cats know who they will choose to be their cat whisperer, which is normally an individual they sense trust with.  Cat whisperers are common with cats, although most people have never heard of them before.  Even though a cat whisperer may be able to communicate better with cats, it will still take time to heal a cat that has been abused. "

These days, it isn’t out of the ordinary to see a cat in virtually every other home, sleeping in the window or cuddling up on the laps of their owners.  Although cats have been popular pets for as long as most can remember, they weren’t domesticated less than 5,000 years or so ago.  Domestication took place in the valley of the Nile, which is what research tells us today. In the beginning, people were very grateful to cats and encouraged them to stay with them by feeding them various scraps of food.  Once they were fed and perceived humans to be no threat, the cats would move in permanently with their human owners.  As time went by, even the wildest of cat would allows humans to approach him, often times even hold and touch as well. In those days, cats were very loyal and endearing pets.  They proved to be great hunters, as they done their sleeping in short periods and were much easier to wake up than dogs.  Cats also have better night vision than dogs, and much better hearing as well.  If someone moved through the house or if they heard suspicious noises, they would wake while dogs would sleep right through it.  Humans loved having cats around, and they seemed to get along good with dogs as well. These days, cats are used for both companionship and show.  They aren’t used much at all for hunting mice and rodent anymore at all.  There are a lot of breeds available, from the traditional alley cat to the well known Siamese.  All breeds are unique in their own way, and will provide you with years of companionship if you take care of them. Before you get a kitten or older cat, you’ll first want to examine the source.  If you are getting the kitten from a breeder, you’ll want to make sure that the breeder has a reputable reputation.  You’ll also want to ensure that the cattery is clean and in good shape.  The kittens that are still there shouldn’t be overcrowded, and their surroundings should be clean.  The litter boxes there should be kept up and both the food and water dish should be clean and full.  The kittens shouldn’t be caged, instead free to run around.  All cats that are there should appear healthy, with shiny coats and none of their ribs showing. When you get your kitten, it should be used to being touched and handled.  The kitten should be sweet, not afraid in the least.  Kittens that have been handled young normally have a better temperament.  The better breeders won’t allow their kittens to leave the nest until they are around 12 weeks old, with some waiting until the kittens are 16 weeks.  By doing this, breeders ensure that the kitten is in good health and his immune system has properly developed. There’s no mistaken the fact that cats are great to own.  You can get a kitten from a reputable breeder, through a local newspaper, or an adoption agency.  Cats can also be obtained from a local pound, although people normally don’t like to choose this option.  No matter which way you decide to pursue, you should always make sure that your cat is healthy.  If you get a healthy cat, you won’t have a lot of problems later on down the road.  Healthy cats were taken care of , and normally have everything up to date , including their vaccinations. "

    "body": "2021/02/22 - These days, cats are among the most popular pet you can own.  There are several breeds available, with the most popular being Persian and Siamese.  Cats are a domesticated animal, with origins dating back some 8,000 years and beyond.  Like any other pet that you may own, including dogs, cats cost money to take care of properly. When you get a cat, you’ll need to think about the costs.  You’ll obviously need food, and you’ll also need to plan ahead for vet costs.  You’ll also need litter, which can tend to get quite expensive as the years go by.  Your cat will need a litter box, food dish, and water dish.  You should also invest in some toys as well, such as a scratching post, cat toys, a pet carrier, and a bed.  You should also look into getting an ID collar as well, just in case your cat ever gets lost. Feeding your pet will depend a great deal on his age.  Older cats require two small meals or one large meal for the day.  Kittens on the other hand, require several feedings a day until they get around the age of 12 weeks.  Cats that are between three and six months of age need to be fed three times a day.  Canned food can be fed to cats, although any food that has been left out longer than 30 minutes need to be disposed of.  Canned food can get expensive fast, and you should always keep in mind that some may need to be thrown away when you buy it.  Cats loved canned food, although it doesn’t have any benefits to their dental health like dry food does. As an alternative plan, you can always leave a supply of dry food out for your pet.  When you give your cat dry food, you should always make sure that he has enough water.  Dry food costs less than canned food, and it can also help to prevent the buildup of tartar on your cat’s teeth.  When you buy dry food, you should always look in terms of health and benefits, and stay away from generic food.  Even though generic food may be cheaper, it may not offer the nutrients your pet needs. If you own a kitten, you should only give you kitten food designed for him.  You’ll also need to clean and refill his water dish every day.  Even though kittens and adult cats like cow’s milk, you should avoid giving it to them as it can cause diarrhea.  Treats are fine on occasion, although too many of them can cause your pet to get fat.  Feeding your kitten human food is good on occasion, although you may have to mix it in with his cat food. By themselves, cats stay fairly clean.  Although you don’t have to bathe them that often, you’ll need to give them a brushing at least once a day.  Brushing will reduce the risk of hairballs and keep your cat’s coat nice and clean.  If you are keeping your cat indoors, you’ll need to have a litter box in an area that is easy for your cat to access.  You should always scoop it on a daily basis, and clean it out once a week.  Cats don’t like to use dirty litter boxes, they prefer for it to be nice and clean. Although cats do require some work, they are great pets that will provide you with years and years of companionship.  As long as you take care of your cat and take him to the vet for his checkups, he should remain healthy.  Even though cats can get sick from time to time and knowing how to care for him will make a world of difference. "

Although most of us have a fondness for cats, that fondness can rapidly diminish when it comes to the litter box.  Even the most hardened cat lover may get tired of litter box duty, especially when it comes down to scooping you know what from the litter box. Cats are very intelligent, instinctively knowing how they should use the litter box.  After the cat has finished using the litter box, someone in the family will need to scoop the waste from the litter box.  This can be a very dirty and somewhat smelly job, one that is often overlooked during the day when the workload gets heavy. Cleaning up the litter box doesn’t take but a few minutes, although most would prefer not to do it at all.  Although the litter box will need to be scooped out daily, it will also need to be changed once a week as well, by throwing the current bag out and replacing the box with a new bag and fresh litter. Those who don’t like to scoop out the litter box should invest in one of the best inventions ever , the self cleaning litter box.  These litter boxes are easy to use, and will keep the area clean.  After the cat has used it, the self cleaning litter box will automatically clean the litter either by sifting or using a device that resembles a rake. Self cleaning boxes that use shifting will often times have a round design.  Once the cat leaves the covered box, the dome on top will revolve for the box to clean.  The litter in the box will be shifted with the waste being put below the litter where it is discarded.  Once the waste is properly disposed of, the litter will be returned to its normal position in the box for the cat to use again. Boxes that have raking systems will often times sport a rectangular design.  Once the cat leaves the box, the rake will automatically come out and clean the litter.  The rake will clean all of the litter in the box, including the clumps of waste as well.  Rakes are popular, although the shifting litter boxes are by far more popular and more common. Those who are often times away from home could greatly benefit from a self cleaning litter box.  They are great to have for cats that spend a lot of time by themselves, as they virtually eliminate any scooping of litter on your part.  You can find them at your local pet or department store, even online as well.  They are very affordable , and ideal for anyone who doesn’t like scooping waste from their litter box. "

You’ll also need to pay attention to his behavior, so you’ll know when he’s sick and when to take him to the vet.  Most of the more common ailments and sicknesses are minor, although there are some cases where a vet can be the determining factor between life and death for your cat. Your cat’s behavior will be one of the most critical factors when you are trying to determine whether or not he is under the weather.  Acting sluggish, laying around all the time, lack of energy and not eating are all signs that you need to take him to the vet immediately.  His coat is also a good thing to watch as well.  If you notice his coat dull and patchy or notice him shedding abnormally, you should contact your vet as soon as you possibly can. Diarrhea and vomiting are sometimes common, even with basic sickness.  On the other hand, if your cat seems to be doing either one of the two for more than a day, you should contact your veterinarian.  Coughing is common as well, simply because coughing will cats dislodge hairballs.  If your cat seems to be coughing for another reason, you should have him checked out as soon as possible. To ensure that your cat isn’t subjected to various diseases, you should always make sure that he stays up do date with his vaccinations. There are several diseases out there that require vaccinations, including rabies and feline distemper.  Feline distemper is one of most devastating diseases a cat can get, yet it is also one of the easiest to prevent as well.  The disease strikes cats very fast, and leaves you as an own very little time to seek treatment. Feline leukemia is another disease that is very deadly, yet can be prevented early on with the proper vaccinations.  Although the disease isn’t possible for humans to contract, it can be spread quickly among cats.  There are vaccinations that can treat the disease these days, although you’ll still want to be careful and not expose other cats around a cat you know has feline leukemia. Another problem, which is very common with cats that stay outdoors, is worms.  Cats that have worms will normally have a lackluster coat and little to no appetite.  There are several different types of worms, including ringworm and hookworm.  Worms can come from fleas, lice, or even the organs of dead rodents that cats consume.  Normally, the cat will digest the eggs which will later mature and attach themselves to the walls of the intestines.  If you feed your cat garlic frequently during feedings, it can help to protect him against worms. If you take care of your cat, chances are you’ll keep him healthy for years to come.  You should always make sure he has quality food, and doesn’t miss any of his scheduled checkups with the vet.  If he gets the proper vaccinations when he is required to get them, he should be safe against numerous pests and diseases.

    "body": "2021/02/22 - Your first line of defense when keeping cats out of your garden is to make sure that you have your boundaries secure.  If there are any gaps in your fence, you should make sure that you block them to prevent any low access.  Cats are very agile animals, and can jump very high.  Normally they can jump a fence, which is why you should also invest in string or taut wire across the top. If a cat has made his way into your garden, it may be hard to get him out.  Most people choose to use dogs, simply because dogs are known to dislike cats. There are several dog breeds out there that completely dislike cats, such as pit bulls and Dobermans.  Cats are completely fearful of these breeds, and will flee if they see them around. All cats are known to despise water as well.  If you spot a cat in your garden, water almost always gets him out.  All it takes is a bucket of water or a well aimed squirt with a garden hose to make him run away.  After you have hit the cat with water several times, he should get the hint not to come back anymore.  If he comes back, simply squirt him or throw more water on him until he gets the idea. Protecting your plants is a different story.  Mothballs are said to be very effective, as cats don’t like the smell.  You can use mothballs around your plants, garden borders, or even along the fence.  There are other repellents that you can use as well, such as cayenne peppers, tobacco, lavender oil, citronella oil, mustard oil, and even lemon grass oil. If you visit your local hardware or lawn store, you can find motion activated sprinklers.  They work great in keeping cats out of your garden.  Once you install the sprinkler system and a cat comes into the area, the detector will pick up the cat’s presence and immediately shoot out a jet of water that will douse the cat.  In most cases, all it takes is a few times of exposure to the sprinkler before a cat learns to stay out of that area. Sound devices that feature high frequencies are also a great way to scare off cats, although they aren’t annoying to humans.  You can find several different models, such as those that stay on all the time, and those that are motion detected.  To use this type of device, you’ll need to make sure that the model you have is strong enough to cover the entire area.  If you model you are using is strong enough to cover your entire garden, it should suffice in scaring off any unwanted animals. You can also use commercial repellents as well.  Commercial repellents use scents to keep cats away, and shouldn’t be used near any food crops.  Due to their high chemical content, commercial repellents can pollute your crops.  You can find them at your local department store, with several varieties to choose from, many of which will fend off other animals from your garden as well. If you have a garden, it can be very annoying if cats and other animals decide to make your garden their home.  If you stick to your guns and do your part, you can prevent them from bothering your garden or your crops.  Once you have secured your boundaries around the garden, you should try using water first.  If water doesn’t seem to work, you can look into another method, such as commercial repellents. "

Although most cats are small in size, you’d be quite amazed with how much power they actually have.  There are ways that you can get your cat to take his pills, which we will cover below. The easiest way to give a cat pill is to crush the power into a powdery form by putting it between two spoons.  Once the pill is powder, mix it in with some wet cat food.  Cats that are used to eating dry cat food will see the wet food and think of it as a treat.  They will normally eat it up, unaware that they just took their medicine. If the medicine happens to be in capsule form, all you have to do is pry the capsule apart then sprinkle the medicine on some wet food and serve it to your pet.  If the food also contains the pill or if your pet is sick, chances are he won’t eat it.  In this event, you should look into a pet piller.  You can get these handy devices from your veterinarian.  They are plastic rods that hold the pill until you press a plunger.  When you get one, you should always get a long one with a softer tip. When you get your gun, your vet should show you how to use it.  The most difficult aspect of using the gun is getting your cat to open his mouth.  The gun will more or less shoot the pill in the cat’s mouth, and down his throat.  You’ll need to hold him tight, to make sure that he doesn’t wiggle his way loose.  Once you have his mouth open, you’ll need to squeeze the trigger and pull the gun away quickly.  After the pill has been inserted, make sure you give your cat a treat. If you aren’t comfortable using the gun, you can always try giving your cat his pills by hand.  To do it this way, you’ll need to hold your cat still, and open his mouth with your hand.  Once you have his mouth open, you should aim for the back of his throat and throw the pill in.  Once it is in his mouth, you should close his mouth with your hand and hold it shut for a few moments.  This way, your cat will swallow the pill if he hasn’t already. If you can’t get any of the above techniques to work, you can always go to a local pharmacy and get them to a make flavored gel or liquid using your cats medication.  You should use this as a last resort though, as it can tend to get expensive. "

Although dander can irritate your skin, it can also get into your immune system as well, resulting in a variety of symptoms and almost immediate allergic reactions. The dander, once in the immune system, is perceived to be a threat.  Even though it isn’t classified as a disease, it’s more of a reflex by your body and your immune system.  Cat allergies occur quite often due to cats having allergens that are spread throughout their blood, urine, and saliva.  Although a cat may not be present at the time, the excretions probably still are. Cat dander, urine, and saliva, are found throughout the home of cat owners.  Cats constantly groom themselves, which involves rubbing their saliva into their fur.  When they do this, they spread their dander and allergens around.  Although you may try, there is really nothing that you can do about it.  Cats have a natural instinct to groom or bathe themselves, no matter how many baths you give them, you simply won’t stop them from grooming. Normally, when someone is taking an allergic reaction to cats, he or she will wheeze, cough, sneeze, itch, have watery eyes, or a difficult time in breathing.  Different people react different ways to cat allergens, meaning that some symptoms may not occur at all.  Fever and chills is very rare, although it can happen.  If someone who has cat allergies comes down with fever and chills, you should contact a doctor immediately.  Chances are, it isn’t an allergic reaction to cats, but instead another type of disease that a doctor will need to identify. Cat allergies are normally treated with antihistamines and decongestants.  Those that experience asthma attacks or other forms of allergies, normally take antihistamines.  Decongestants on the other hand, are normally used to cure coughs and swollen nasal passages.  Sometimes, doctors will recommend allergy shots as well.  Allergy shots can help to prevent the attack, especially if someone is really allergic to cats.  They are a good form of treatment and prevention, and they can also help to decrease the risk of allergies affecting the individual. If you suspect that you have cat allergies, you should always make it a point to visit your doctor.  He will be able to further diagnose your situation, and give you the best options available for treatment.  If you do indeed suffer from cat allergies, the best way to stop the attacks is to get rid of your cat. Getting rid of a cat can be a very tough thing to do.  If you have become allergic to your cat’s fur, there may be no other way to prevent attacks than to get rid of him.  Although doctors can give you medicine and shots, it will only do so much.  Cat allergens are no fun, especially if you develop them years after owning your cat.  Cats are great animals to own - although cat allergies are something we could all live without. "

    "title": "Curing Bad Cat Breath",
    "body": "2021/02/22 - Cat owners know for a fact that bad cat breath can be downright awful.  It isn’t that much different from bad human breath, as both are caused by bacteria found in the mouth that breaks protein down and releases the sulfur compounds out into the air.  Sulfur smells really bad on its own, which is why breath containing it smells bad as well.  The bacterium that causes bad breath with cats is normally associated with a buildup of tartar around the teeth.  Tartar is yellow in color, known as a coating of bacteria, food, and minerals. To cure your cat from bad breath, you’ll need to remove the buildup of tartar.  There are several cat foods out there that are designed to reduce the buildup of tartar, many containing enzymes that will literally dissolve it.  You can also give your cat treats as well, as many of them will help eliminate and prevent tartar.  If the buildup of tartar is bad, you may need to have your cat’s teeth professionally cleaned.  Once the tartar has been removed, the bad breath will go away. You may be able to clean the tartar off your cat’s teeth at home.  There are several toothpastes available for pets, available in several different flavors.  You’ll need to get a mechanical toothbrush, as the motion is very important for removing tartar buildup.  Toothpastes that contain enzymes will dissolve tartar, helping to cure bad breath.  If you start early with brushing your cat’s teeth, you can virtually eliminate any type of tartar buildup that will ultimately lead to bad breath. Some bacteria that lead to tartar can be found in your cat’s diet.  When you feed him, you should always make sure that the food he consumes doesn’t contain a lot of bacteria.  If you shop healthy and feed him only healthy foods, it can help his bad breath a great deal.  When you give your pet a treat, make sure that the treat is designed to help with tartar.  After your cat has finished eating, you can brush his teeth or rinse his mouth out.  This way, you’ll get the bacteria out of his mouth before it has time to build up on his teeth. Sometimes, cats may have a bad odor in their mouth that doesn’t come from tartar or bad breath in general.  In these rare cases, it can be either liver or kidney disease.  If you notice bad breath and it isn’t tartar, you should take your cat to the vet.  Even though it may be something to do with tartar, it’s better to be safe than sorry.  Your veterinarian can pinpoint the problem, let you know what the cause is and how you should go about fixing it. "

    "title": "Common Meanings Of Cat Behavior",
    "body": "2021/02/22 - A lot of people think that cats work on their own agenda, not paying much attention to their owner and provided they have clean litter, food, and water.  Cats can behave in odd manners at times, which can easily confuse their owners and make it really hard to determine what the cat wants.  As much as cat behavior can be confusing, there are some ways that you can solve common cat behavior mysteries. A common behavior that almost all cats do is push their heads into any type of object that will allow them to do it.  You’ve probably seen your cat do this before, probably against table legs, TV stands, or another object.  This can be noticed more when you have other people who own animals or those with allergies over at your house.  When a cat notices this, he will rub his head against the person.  In doing so, he will put a touch of saliva on the individual.  In a cat’s mind, he owns what he puts his saliva on. By putting his saliva on something, that object or person will have a familiar scent.  Although this can be very annoying, you have to understand that other people in your home are seen as odd or weird to your cat.  When a cat does this, he is simply trying to make the visitor belong.  When he brushes up against them and puts his saliva on them, he is trying to put his scent on them and which in his mind will mean that they belong in his territory. Even though marking someone or something with saliva is beneficial to the cat, saliva is one of the most common forms of pet allergies.  When someone wipes the saliva off of them, the scent will be gone and the cat will go back and attempt to do it again.  Even though it may appear that cats target those with allergies, cats are actually just trying to make the visitor belong at the house.  If the guest simply cannot take the saliva, allow the cat to rub himself on their pants leg a few times.  Normally, this is all takes for a cat to leave the person alone. Those of you who an indoor cat should expect the cat to spend quite a bit of time lying near windows.  During this time, you may hear your cat make very strange noises or weird movements.  You shouldn’t fear though, as he is simply acting out his hunting instincts.  Whether it’s another cat or object outside moving about, the cat will see it and simply go into his native hunting instinct. As most already know, cats love to play.  They love to played with, especially with toys.  They will pounce on things on occasion, which should always be expected.  If you try to prevent this type of behavior, your cat will take a very negative approach and you’ll end up with a lot of broken things in your home.  You can always play with your cat using a string, as he will love to chase the string around the room. The longer you own your cat, the more odd behavior you’ll see him exhibit.  Cats behave in strange ways, although they always have a reason for behaving the way they do.  If you can understand why your cat behaves like he does, you’ll have no problems keeping him healthy and happy.  If you simply pay attention to your cat and the way he behaves at times and you’ll be able to understand him better than ever before. "

    "body": "2021/02/22 -  Worms Hairball Urinary tract infection Feline leukemiaIf you are new to owning a cat, you may be surprised to find that health problems are a common thing.  No matter what breed of cat you own, health problems are to be expected.  Some may be hereditary, while others can easily be prevented. Worms: No matter what breed of cat it may be, worms are a very common and recurring problem.  Tapeworms, roundworms, and hookworms are among the most common that infect cats.  Cats who have problems gaining weight, problems with fleas, or if you find white specks in his stool, you should have your vet test him for worms.  Although they can be treated with medicine, worms can prove to be fatal if they are left untreated. Hairball: Hairballs are the most common health problem for cats.  All cats groom themselves on a daily basis, normally swallowing the loose hair that comes from their coats.  On occasion, this loose hair will gather into a ball and become lodged in the digestive tract instead of passing through in your cat’s stool.  When your cat starts to cough and hack, he is normally coughing up a hairball.  Although it can be rather disgusting in the end, most cats can dislodge hairballs without any problems. In rare cases, a hairball can pass through to a cat’s intestine, creating a blockage.  Blockages are very serious problems, and can be life threatening if they aren’t treated.  If your cat becomes constipated, isn’t eating properly, or has a very dull coat, he could have a blockage.  If you notice any of these symptoms, you should take him to the vet immediately.  You can prevent hairballs and blockages by brushing your cat 2 and 3 times a week to remove loose hair.  You can also feed him food that is designed to control hairballs as well. Urinary tract infection: Urinary tract infection is also a common health problem with cats.  Urinary tract infection is more common with male cats that haven’t been neutered, although females can suffer from this problem as well.  When a cat suddenly stops going to his litter box, this problem is normally the cause.  Another symptom is when the cat’s urine starts to smell really strong.  If you suspect that your cat has a urinary tract infection, you should take him to the vet.  Your vet can treat the problem with medicine, and make recommendations to help avoid this problem in the future. Feline leukemia: In the past, feline leukemia was the biggest cause of death in cats. These days however, there are vaccines available that can treat the disease.  To treat the disease, your cat will need to be given the shot before he or she is exposed.  Even though death doesn’t happen immediately, cats that are exposed to feline leukemia normally don’t have a long life span.  If you know your cat has feline leukemia, you should never allow other cats around him, as the virus is highly contagious. To protect your cat, you should always make sure that you take him to the vet for his regular check ups.  If you keep him up to date on his vaccinations, he should lead a healthy and productive life.  Although some health problems can’t be avoided, most of them can.  You can also keep your cat indoors as well, which will protect him from a majority of health problems.  If your cat is an outdoor cat, regular visits to the vet will keep him healthy.  As long as you take your cat to the vet and keep him healthy and he will be your companion for years to come. "

    "body": "2021/02/22 - There are a lot of experts out there who say that cats are strictly independent animals.  These very same experts state that cats have chosen to associate with humans due to their strategy of survival.  Although many argue with this statement, there are many who agree as well although those that agree are normally those in the percentile who don’t agree with cats. Anyone who has owned a cat will tell you that cats are great at bonding with people, although they are very particular.  Normally, a cat will choose someone in the home that he bonds with.  You’ll know when a cat wants to bond with you, as he will hop on your lap seeking attention or snuggle up to you at night when you are sleeping.  Purring is a strong sign of affections, especially with cats that are looking to bond. Although many experts have tried to figure it out, no one really knows why cats choose a particular person whom they will bond with.  It could be the individual’s manners, voice, or simply how that person treats the cat.  Perhaps it may be the individual is really gentle, or maybe a little more forceful bringing the best out in the cat. There are a lot of ways that researchers have tried to take this subject, one of which being psychic.  Some say that cats bond with someone due to a psychic aura that is compatible with both the person and the cat.  If a cat feels that someone is giving them a bad vibe, they will simply ignore that person.  Although this can be true to a sense for some, a majority of those who own cats will tell you that this couldn’t be any further from the truth. Even though there are a lot of theories and speculation out there, no one really knows why cats bond with humans.  There’s little to no proof available as well, other than cats and their natural instinct for physical survival.  Those who own cats know that cats crave attention, simply to make them feel needed.  They love to be pampered by their owners, and will shower you with attention and affection if you just give them the chance. Those who are new to owning cats may find bonding to be very different.  Cats are different from other animals, including dogs, in the sense that they bond different.  Different breeds of cats will bond different with their owners, although most prefer affection and attention.  The more time you spend around your cat, the more he will bond with you.  Over the years, you’ll find that the bond you create with your pet has grown very strong and simply cannot be broken. "

    "body": "2021/02/22 - Cats are one of the most popular pets in North America.  They are loving pets, capable of providing you years of companionship.  Like other pets, cats can sometimes get sick.  There are several different types of ailments that cats can get, one of which is feline diabetes.  Feline diabetes is a serious disease, although it can be treated by a veterinarian. Diabetes is more common with humans than with cats or other animals. The cause of diabetes is actually quite simple.  Sugar, or glucose, is found in the blood.  The level of blood sugar in the body or the animal is kept under control by hormone insulin, which the pancreas produces.  When the pancreas doesn’t produce enough insulin, diabetes is to blame. The symptoms of feline diabetes will vary.  The most common symptoms include an increase in urine and an increase in thirst.  Other symptoms of feline diabetes include a loss of appetite, weight loss, and a poor coat.  An increase in thirst is easy to detect, as you can easily notice the water dish empty throughout the day. If you don’t get your cat treated for feline diabetes immediately, the cat will eventually become inactive, vomit on a regular basis, and eventually fall into a coma.  On the other hand, if you get the diabetes treated in time, the cat will more than likely lead a normal and healthy life.  Keep in mind that treatment doesn’t happen overnight ‘ it takes time and dedication. Cats that have feline diabetes will need to be given food at the same time every day. They should be prevented from going outside as well.  If your cat has diabetes, you’ll need to give him insulin shots once or twice or a day.  Once your veterinarian checks your cat, he will tell you how many shots and how much insulin you need to give your cat. Before you give your cat his insulin shot, you should always make sure that he has some food first.  If he hasn’t eaten and you give him a shot anyway, he could end up with a hypoglycemic shock.  This can also occur from too much insulin as well.  A hypo can be really dangerous, and should be avoided at all costs.  If your cat gets a hypoglycemic shock and you aren’t around, he may end up dying. If you have to give insulin shots to your cat due to feline diabetes, you should always keep a watchful eye on him after you have administered the shot.  After your cat has been on insulin for a period of time, your vet may reduce the amount of insulin.  Even though he may have to stay on insulin the rest of his life, he will lead an otherwise healthy life. "

Siamese cats, in the past, were trusted to protect royal palaces and monasteries from evil spirits.  These cats were also thought of as bringing good fortune to their owners as well. During the year of 1884, the very first Siamese cats began to make their way to England, when they were given as gifts to a British general.

    "body": "2021/02/08 - Banyak dari kita yang menyukai kucing, dan mungkin banyak juga di antara pembaca yang memelihara kucing di rumah. Satwa lucu ini sudah menjadi hewan peliharaan kesayangan manusia sejak 7500 sebelum masehi, terutama di wilayah-wilayah sekitar Mediterania. Di Indonesia sendiri, menurut data yang diperoleh dari Rakuten Insight, sekitar 37% dari populasi memiliki kucing di rumahnya. Meski begitu dengan dengan kita, bisa jadi, tak banyak dari kita yang mengetahui fakta-fakta menarik kucing, seperti yang dihimpun oleh Science Focus ini. Cara tercepat bersahabat dengan kucing: Para ilmuwan telah menemukan bahwa mengeryitkan mata kita adalah cara terbaik untuk membangun hubungan persahabatan dengan kucing. Dalam sebuah studi oleh universitas Portsmouth dan Sussex, para peneliti menemukan bahwa teknik tersebut meniru apa yang dikenal sebagai senyuman kucing – disebut sebagai Slow Blink, atau ‘kedipan lambat’ – dan tampaknya membantu membentuk ikatan antara manusia dan kucing. “Sebagai seseorang yang telah mempelajari perilaku hewan dan merupakan pemilik kucing, sangat menyenangkan dapat menunjukkan bahwa kucing dan manusia dapat berkomunikasi dengan cara ini,” kata Profesor Karen McComb, dari Sekolah Psikologi di Universitas Sussex, yang melakukan supervisi penelitian tersebut. “Cobalah mengernyitkan mata Anda pada mereka seperti saat Anda tersenyum santai, diikuti dengan menutup mata Anda selama beberapa detik. Anda akan melihat sang kucing merespon dengan cara yang sama dan dari sini, Anda dapat memulai semacam pertemanan ” lanjut Karen. Studi tersebut mengungkapkan bahwa kucing lebih cenderung berkedip lambat pada pemiliknya setelah pemiliknya berkedip lambat pada mereka, dibandingkan saat mereka tidak berinteraksi sama sekali. Satu dari 10 kucing peliharaan mengalami kegelisahan akan perpisahan: Lebih dari satu dari 10 kucing peliharaan yang disurvei dalam sebuah penelitian telah memperlihatkan perubahan perilaku saat terpisah dari pemiliknya untuk sementara. Dalam studi tersebut, para peneliti juga mengamati bahwa kucing akan begitu gelisah saat ditinggal sang pemilik, terutama di rumah tangga yang tak terdapat wanitanya. Selain itu, tidak adanya mainan untuk kucing, serta tidak adanya hewan peliharaan lain di rumah, juga akan membuat kucing begitu cemas dan gelisah saat ditinggal pemilik untk sementara. Dari kucing-kucing yang diteliti, ditemukan bahwa 13,5 persen dari semua sampel kucing menunjukkan setidaknya satu dari beberapa ciri yang terkait dengan masalah terkait perpisahan, dengan perilaku merusak yang paling sering dilaporkan (20 dari 30 kucing). Ciri-ciri perilaku lain seperti memeong berlebihan (19 kucing), buang air kecil di tempat yang tidak tepat (18 kucing), agresif (11 kucing), gelisah dan mondar-mandir (11 kucing) dan buang air besar yang tidak tepat (tujuh kucing) juga diamati. Depresi-apatis, yang ditandai dengan kurangnya energi dan kehilangan minat, juga terlihat pada 16 kucing dengan masalah terkait perpisahan. Kucing Benar-benar Bisa Menyayangi Kita: Banyak yang beranggapan bahwa kucing adalah hewan yang cuek dan malas, tak seperti anjing yang sering terlihat antusias bila ada di sekitar manusia yang memeliharanya. Namun, anggapan itu tak benar. Jejak hubungan saling menguntungkan antara manusia dengan kucing ditegaskan dengan adanya analisis kimiawi terhadap tulang kucing berusia 5. 300 tahun dari China menunjukkan bahwa di masa itu kucing menjadi pemburu hewan pengerat yang hidup di dalam gudang makanan manusia, sehingga orang-orang di China masa itu kemudian memberinya tempat tinggal dan berlindung, dan kemudian membiarkan mereka memburu tikus-tikus. Seiring berjalannya waktu, setidaknya dalam budaya Barat, kucing rumahan mulai dirawat dengan hati-hati, diberi makan khusus, kadang dibawa ke salon, dan sebagainya.  Bagi banyak orang dan keluarga, kucing bukan lagi hewan peliharaan yang diberi makan minum dan tempat tinggal, namun sudah seperti keluarga. Pada September 2019, para ilmuwan menyatakan bahwa kucing tampaknya menunjukkan ciri-ciri secure attachment “keterikatan yang kuat” terhadap manusia, seperti yang terlihat pada anjing, di mana kehadiran manusia pemeliharanya memicu perilaku yang menandakan keamanan dan ketenangan. Kucing Bisa Merasakan Tanda-tanda akan datangnya hujan badai: Kucing dan banyak hewan lain lebih sensitif daripada manusia terhadap suara, bau, dan perubahan tekanan atmosfer, dan indra mereka yang meningkat memungkinkan mereka menangkap petunjuk bahwa badai akan datang jauh sebelum pemiliknya mengetahui hal itu. Tepat sebelum badai, telinga bagian dalam kucing Anda mungkin mendeteksi penurunan tekanan atmosfer yang tiba-tiba, dan dia mungkin telah belajar untuk mengaitkannya dengan badai yang akan datang. Jika badai sudah berkecamuk di kejauhan, dia mungkin bisa melihat gemuruh petir yang samar. Selain itu, ia mungkin bisa mencium bau hujan yang masuk, atau bau khas gas ozon, yang sering kali tercipta dari petir dan memiliki bau logam yang tajam. Kucing dapat mempengaruhi kehidupan liar di sekitar rumah: Siapa sangka, kucing rumahan ternyata membunuh lebih banyak mangsa di area tertentu daripada predator liar berukuran serupa. Menurut sebuah penelitian yang dilakukan oleh beberapa ilmuwan dari North Carolina State University and the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, AS pada Maret 2020, menyatakan bahwa perburuan oleh hewan peliharaan dapat berdampak besar pada populasi satwa liar setempat. Ilmuwan mengatakan efeknya sebagian besar terkonsentrasi di sekitar rumah kucing, karena sebagian besar pergerakan mereka berada dalam radius 100 m. Ini biasanya mencakup beberapa taman di kedua sisinya. Studi tersebut menunjukkan bahwa kucing peliharaan membunuh dua hingga 10 kali lebih banyak satwa liar daripada predator liar yang setara. Penulis utama dari studi tersebut, Roland Kays berkata, “Karena mereka diberi makan makanan kucing, hewan peliharaan membunuh lebih sedikit mangsa per hari dibandingkan predator liar, tetapi wilayah jelajah mereka sangat kecil sehingga efek ini pada mangsa lokal akhirnya menjadi sangat terkonsentrasi. “Ditambah dengan kepadatan tinggi kucing peliharaan yang tidak wajar di beberapa daerah, dan risiko populasi burung dan mamalia kecil menjadi lebih buruk. ” Menurut penelitian, kucing rumahan membunuh rata-rata 14,2 hingga 38,9 mangsa per 100 hektar, atau hektar, per tahun. Studi tersebut juga menunjukkan bahwa kucing melakukan banyak kerusakan pada satwa liar di habitat yang terganggu, seperti pembangunan perumahan. Kucing tak bisa makan sayur dan buah: Di alam liar, kucing sepenuhnya adalah hewan karnivora, dan ada beberapa asam amino yang hanya ditemukan dalam daging, seperti taurin, yang tidak dapat disintesis atau disimpan, jadi pola makan kucing vegan harus disesuaikan dengan sangat hati-hati dengan usia dan berat badannya. Terlalu sedikit taurin dapat menyebabkan kebutaan dan gagal jantung, sementara terlalu banyak dapat menyebabkan infeksi saluran kemih yang serius. Kucing karnivora menyerap semua taurin yang mereka butuhkan dari daging, tetapi taurin sintetis yang ditambahkan ke makanan vegan hadir dalam beberapa bentuk berbeda, yang diserap oleh metabolisme kucing dengan kecepatan berbeda. Hal ini membuat sangat sulit untuk memberi kucing pola makan vegan yang seimbang. Kumis Kucing Membuat Mereka Menjadi Pembunuh Handal: Ciri khas ‘kumis’ vibrissae kucing, terdiri dari 24 atau lebih bulu yang bisa bergerak, disertai dengan kumis lain yang kurang terlihat di atas mata, di dagu, dan bagian belakang cakar depan (kumis karpal). Rambut-rambut yang tebal ini terhubung dengan saraf yang mengakar dalam yang membantu kucing melakukan perburuan bahkan di kondisi gelap gulita Kumis wajah sejajar dengan lebar tubuh untuk membantu mengukur jarak saat bergerak, dan pembunuhan dimungkinkan oleh ‘proprioseptor’, organ sensorik khusus di ujung yang memantau jarak, arah, dan bahkan tekstur mangsa. Kumis mereka juga memantau aliran udara untuk mengoordinasikan pergerakannya lebih lanjut. sumber :  rakuten. com, sciencefocus. com, pets. thenest. com "

    "body": "2021/02/08 - Pandemi covid 19 ini benar-benar untuk belajar banyak informasi literasi dan buku yang sebelumnya belum sempat aku baca sekarang jadi ada banyak waktu buat baca terutama soal bagaimana dunia ini bekerja kenapa harus ada PBB kenapa negara-negara ngutang ke imf atau World Bank Kenapa Bank Sentral tiap negara itu harus independen Kenapa perekonomian dan teknologi dunia sekarang ini didominasi oleh orang-orang yahudi walaupun mereka berdomisili di Amerika Serikat tentu asal keturunan nya dulu Yahudi juga dan Kenapa ada segelintir elit yang terobsesi banget pengen mendirikan negara Israel Kenapa Israel lengket banget sama Amerika Serikat dan kenapa agenda 21 PBB itu walaupun ditentang senat Amerika Serikat dan aktivis di Indonesia tapi tetap harus dilaksanakan agenda pemberian digital ID kepada setiap warga negara anggota PBB yang ikut dalam agenda 21 PBB semuanya mulai terjawab pelan-pelan yang unik ini soal alasan kenapa Bank Sentral setiap negara itu harus independen pemerintah nggak boleh ikut campur pemerintah harus menurut keputusan ekonomi dari bank sentral begitu pula dengan negara-negara lain Mereka semua pemerintahnya nurut pada kebijakan bank sentral kalau di Indonesia ada Bank Indonesia yang jadi Bank Sentral kalian gak bisa buka rekening di sini karena Bi hanya mentransfer uang ke bank komersial dan lembaga keuangan lain di Indonesia semula ku pikir kenapa Bank Sentral harus independen itu karena semua negara ini berpatokan mata uangnya pada US Dollar dan menurut articles of agreement of the IMF hanya mau meminjamkan dana kepada bank sentral yang independen kalau nggak independen nggak bisa ternyata ada lagi alasan kenapa Bank Sentral itu harus independen ini mengacu pada segelintir elit bankir yang menguasai bank for International settlements di Swiss atau biasanya disebut BIS Ini adalah banknya semua bank sentral di seluruh dunia Walaupun sahamnya dipegang oleh semua Bank Sentral negara tapi di dalam bank yang super power ini ada semacam pemimpin dalamnya gitu kebetulan aku menemu liputan dari seorang jurnalis investigasi senior yang biasa nulis berita tentang politik dan artikelnya sudah pernah dipublikasikan di majalah harper’s dan ulasannya tentang BIS ini menarik banget isinya bakal aku tulis ulang di video ini kalau kita lihat struktur pemimpin itu begini yang pertama ada board of director ya tugas dan fungsinya sama lah dengan fotografernya Federal Reserve atau Bank Sentral secara official board of director ini bertugas memimpin operasional bank kalau di buat off direkturnya diisi oleh Gubernur Bank Sentral negara maju terkemuka di dunia yakni Gubernur Bank Sentral dari negara-negara inggris Swiss Jerman Italia Belgia Swedia dan Belanda tugas mereka Selain mengurus operasional mereka juga harus melakukan di Line di Line dengan lembaga keuangan atau organisasi internasional lainnya seperti IMF World Bank Europe and Economic Community dan masih banyak lagi yang kedua ada grup often atau biasa disebut sebagai G 10 G 10 ini punya anggota tetap yakni semua Gubernur Bank Sentral Eropa yang jadi board of director ditambah Gubernur Federal Reserve ditambah Gubernur Bank of Canada dan ditambah Gubernur band of japan dan ada satu member G 10 yang tidak resmi yakni Gubernur otoritas moneter Arab Saudi setiap bulan kecuali bulan Agustus dan Oktober kedua elemen di atas yang jadi elemen inti dan pemimpin dari melakukan pertemuan di pertemuan ini disebut dengan bangsa weekend pertemuan ini berlangsung clusif dan sangat rahasia tidak boleh diliput oleh media dan untuk para gubernur Bank Sentral yang mengikuti pertemuan ini mereka tidak perlu izin ke pemerintah masing-masing langsung datang saja apa yang mereka bahas dalam pertemuan besok weekend ini Ya jelas aja tentang tatanan moneter dunia Bagaimana sirkulasi uang di dunia saat ini pengaturan cadangan emas dunia Negara mana yang mata uangnya harus di Devaluasi Negara mana yang mata uangnya boleh dipertahankan Negara mana yang harus ditambah hutang negara mana yang harus di utak-atik dan masih banyak lagi semua berkaitan dengan tatanan moneter Global merekalah yang mengendalikan dan kantor Bis tempat mereka bertemu ini canggih banget setiap member inti memiliki kantor dengan komputer ekstra canggih dan telepon khusus yang semuanya langsung tersambung ke bank sentral negara mereka masing-masing sewaktu-waktu bank Sentral ini butuh data dari negara mereka mereka bisa langsung akses secara real-time dan tentang Bank Sentral seluruh dunia ini suka membuka rekening di bank karena biaya adalah bank yang sangat terjaga kerahasiaannya dan sangat kebal terhadap hukum negara manapun Jadi Bank Sentral menyimpan uang dan emas mereka di sini lalu digunakan untuk transaksi apapun tidak ada pemerintah atau lembaga hukum yang bisa menyentuh Inilah sebabnya BIS pernah disebut sebagai sarana cuci uang Bank sentralnya Jerman kuno pasca perang dunia ke-2 di mana waktu itu Bank Sentral Jerman melakukan perampasan puluhan ton emas dari negara cekoslowakia yang berhasil mereka duduki transaksi manilondring dilakukan melalui rekening rekening bank sentral Jerman di BIS tapi sampai sekarang tidak ada hukum negara dan internasional yang bisa mengusut kasus ini sebagai bentuk kejahatan perang ya karena ini sangat rahasia dan kebal hukum sebenarnya di tahun 1944 BIS pernah mau dibubarkan saat konferensi bretton Woods maunya diganti dengan World Bank dan IMF saja John Maynard Keynes adalah ekonom asal Amerika Serikat yang getol banget meminta BIS buat dibubarkan tapi suara dia kalah dan seluruh perwakilan Bank Sentral tetap ingin dia ada karena kerahasiaan dan keamanan transaksinya setelah itu Amerika Serikat malah Menggunakan biaya untuk melakukan transaksi perdagangan ilegal dengan Jerman pasca perang dunia ke-2 sebenarnya selain 2 member inti di atas ada sebuah klub rahasia yang menjadi pemimpin dari pemimpinnya BIS lebih kuat kekuasaannya daripada operator dan ke-10 Biasanya mereka disebut sebagai inner inner klub ini terdiri dari orang-orang pemikiran yang sama tentang moneter dunia bahwa moneter dunia haruslah terbebas dari kepentingan politik negara manapun karena itu Bank Sentral harus mandiri dan independen dan bebas dari campur tangan pemerintah para bankir dunia dapat mengontrol suatu negara melalui kontrol ekonomi dari bangsa jadi merekalah inner club di bias elite bankir yang selama ini mengontrol moneter dunia dari sebuah bank yang sangat powerfull dan kebal hukum bank for International settlements Richard Febrian dalam bukunya Global financial integration di geografi menulis sebagai berikut Bagaimana kuatnya kekuasaan BIS di swiss di pasar keuangan tren menuju semacam pemerintahan Global paling baik diwakili oleh upaya supervisi bank di bawah kekuasaan di di Basel Swiss untuk menentukan persyaratan modal minimum pada bank bank sentral dunia dan untuk mengintegrasikan dan mengkoordinasikan pengawasan perbankan pasar sekuritas dan asuransi Dari sini bisa kelihatan saja kan Bagaimana power full Bang ini sampai dia itu bisa merepresentasikan tatanan Global dunia Jadi kalau kalian baru panik soal tatanan dunia baru sekarang sebenarnya sudah telat banget sejak sebelum Perang Dunia satu saja sebenarnya para elit bankir Global sudah mulai menata dunia menjadi tatanan yang mereka inginkan kroscek melalui keluarga dan agen-agennya kekuasaan Bank Sentral negara-negara maju eropa seperti Inggris dan Perancis sejak abad ke-19 mendirikan Federal Reserve lalu mendirikan pipis di tahun 1930 melalui agen-agen sekarang ini nasib moneter setiap negara didunia bergantung dari elite bankir yang berkuasa dibias kartel perbankan telah didirikan negara dikontrol kedaulatannya melalui pengontrolan ekonomi via kartel perbankan
